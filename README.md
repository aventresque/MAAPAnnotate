# MAAPAnnotate

MAAPAnnotate is an HoloLens application which provides an innovative method of interacting with megalithic art.
You can find in this github all the data you need to launch the corresponding Unity file.

You need to add HoloToolkit to your unity project: https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity.

After adding HoloToolkit, you can build the app in Unity, and then deploy it on the HoloLens from Visual Studio 2017.
To do so: First plug the HoloLens to your computer, then in Visual Studio 2017 select "Master", "x86", and "Device" and deploy the app by clicking on "Debug" -> "Start without debugging".
You can then directly launch the app from the HoloLens.

In order to view what is displayed in the HoloLens, go to the Windows Device Portal http://127.0.0.1:10080/ when the HoloLens is plugged.
